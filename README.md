# Flightbook API
Flightbook is a personal logbook for paraglider and hang glider pilots. The flights must be registered manually and the logbook is not connected to any GPS.

Why is-it not connected to GPS?
There exist a lot of application that are connected to the GPS but often you don’t want to register the track but you just like to have a trace of the flight. For example: Tandem pilots

## History
I started with this project in 2013 and first it was used from some Friends and me. 2015 I published the first mobile application version and developed a Symfony web page. 2020 I decided to redevelop the mobile application with the Ionic Framework, the backend with nestjs and make the entire project open source.
